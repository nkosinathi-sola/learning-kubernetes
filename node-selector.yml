    # to limit this pod to run on a larger node we define selector
  nodeSelector:
    # size large will be defined as a label assigned to the node
    # the scheduler uses these labels to match and identify the size/right node to place the pod on
    size: Large  

# to label the node
# kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
# > kubectl label nodes node-1 size=Large

# now that we've labelled the node, we can get back to creating the pod
# kubectl create -f pod-definition.yml

# for more complex situation like placing a pod on Large OR Medium Node
# Node Affinity is used
# with nodeSelector you can not provide advanced expressions
