# the easy approach is to stick to a source code management system like Github, GitLab

# another approach will be to query the aip server and store the outputs in a yml file
kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml > all-deploy-services.yaml

# tools like VELERO can help you take backups of your K8S cluster using the K8S API




# you can also choose to backup the ETCD cluster itsself
# ETCD comes with a built in snapshot
# you can take a snapshot of an etcd databse

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
      snapshot save snapshot.db # takes a snapshot

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
      snapshot status snapshot.db # view the snapshot   



# to restore a cluster from this backup
service kube-apiserver stop # stop the kube aip server service

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
      snapshot restore snapshot.db \ # run restore command
      --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup # specifiy path with the backup

systemctl daemon-reload

service etcd restart


# to check the version on etcd runnning on the cluster - inspect the etcd pod
# etcd is deployed as a pod and it should be in the kubesystem namespace
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl -n kube-system describe pod etcd-controlplane
