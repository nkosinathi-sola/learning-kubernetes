# static pods are created by the kubelet without the intervantion of the Kube apiVersion
# the files are stored in /etc/kubernetes/manifests (it could be any directory on the host)
# the location of that dir is passsed as an option while running the service
# the option is passed as: 
    --pod-manifest-path=/etc/Kubernetes/manifests

# you can only create pods with this (not replicasets, deployments, services, etc)
# kubelete works on a pods level thats why it understands this

once static files are created, you can view them using 
> docker ps 
# but why docker?
# because we dont have the rest of the kubernetes cluster so the kubectl utility works with the kube api server
