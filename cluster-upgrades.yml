# >kubeadm upgrade plan
# the above command gives you detailed information about your cluster upgrade

# in a scenerio upgrading from v1.11
# upgrade kubeadm
apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.12.0

# upgrade kubelets next
apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00
systemctl restart kubelet


# Upgrade worker nodes
# ____________________

# move the workloads first from the first worker node to the other nodes
# use the drain command to safely terminate all the pods from a node  and reschedule them on the other nodes
kubectl drain node-1
# it also cordons the node and marks it unschedulable, that way no new pods are scheduled on it.
# then upgrade the kubeadm and kubelet packages on the worker nodes as done first on the master
apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00
apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00
kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version v1.12.0 # upgrade the node configuration
systemctl restart kubelet # restart the kubelet service
# the node should be up 

# NB: when we drained the node, we marked it unschedulable, so we need to unmark it
kubectl uncordoon node-1

# the node is now schedulable
# but remember that its is not neccessary that the pods come right back to this node - it is only marked schedulable
# only when the pods are deleted from the other nodes or when new nodes are scheduled, do they really come back to this node
